GitStub is a Chrome extension that uses the GitHub API to create a list of recommendations of repositories related to the one being browsed by the user. Results are displayed alongside the current repo, or in addition to a specific user profile, providing a seamless experience that helps you jump off into cool projects relevant to your interests.
